# Build the Next.js dashboard ($PLUGIN_ROOT/dashboard) in two steps:
#   1. npm ci (skipped if node_modules exists and is newer than package.json
#      and package-lock.json)

# Designed to run detached from any hook so the multi-minute first-run
# cost never trips Claude Code's hook timeout. dashboard-service.sh
# spawns this on first SessionStart when .next is missing; the user can
# also invoke it manually for recovery.
#
# Concurrency: a build-pid file at $STATE_DIR/dashboard-build.pid is
# used to mark "build in progress" so dashboard-open.sh can surface a
# "still building, retry in ~1 minute" message instead of the generic
# .next-missing error. The pid file is removed on exit (success, fail,
# or interrupt).
#
# Partial-build safety: an INT/TERM trap wipes any half-written .next
# so dashboard-service.sh's "no .next → start build" probe stays honest.

# When npm's node process spawns a cmd.exe grandchild for a lifecycle/run script
# (`node -e ...`, `next build`), that oversized environment is truncated for the
# child, dropping the entries the script needs — nodejs and npm-appended
# node_modules/.bin — so bare `node`/`next` resolve to "not found" and the build
# aborts. Deduplicating (order-preserving) shrinks it back under the threshold;
# an identical small PATH is what makes an interactive build succeed. Anchor
# nodejs at the front too, so node survives even a residual truncation.

# builds (e.g., smart-install.sh and a SessionStart-driven dashboard-service.sh
# firing within milliseconds on first install) cannot both pass this check.
# BUILD_PID_FILE remains as status metadata for dashboard-open.sh and

# and removed only by the lock holder.
# The pid file is written (below) only AFTER mkdir acquires the lock, so
# there is a brief window where the lock dir exists but the pid file does
# not. A peer arriving in that window must NOT treat the missing pid as a
# stale lock and steal it — doing so lets two builds run `npm ci` in the
# same dir, and each failure path wipes node_modules, clobbering the other
# (repeated "npm ci failed" across sessions, dashboard never builds).
# Disambiguate the two causes of "missing pid" by the lock dir's age:
#   - young lock, no pid  -> peer is mid-acquire; back off
#   - aged lock,  no pid  -> holder crashed before writing pid; reclaim
# LOCK_ACQUIRE_GRACE must exceed the mkdir->pid-write gap but stay well
# below a real build, so a genuinely crashed holder is still reclaimed.
