## Why Learning, Not Memory

Most memory solutions are still mostly informative—Claude remembers what happened, without necessarily changing what it does next.

`claude-smart` focuses on learning instead.

Four ways this changes what your coding assistant can do for you:

- 💡 **Stop repeating the same mistakes:** Produces actionable skills Claude can follow next time; memory only records what happened.

  > *Example:* a deploy fails after Claude bumps `prisma` from 5.x to 6.0; you tell it to roll back because 6.0 breaks nested writes in your order flow.<br>
  > **Memory:** “deploy broke after prisma bump; user rolled back”<br>
  > **Learning:** “treat major-version bumps of ORMs/DB drivers as breaking — verify with integration tests, not just unit tests”

- 🚀 **Start from the optimized path:** Preserves and optimizes execution paths so Claude can reuse what already works.
  > *Example:* Claude spends several iterations trying to start the local dev environment before discovering that this repo requires `pnpm dev:all` instead of the usual `npm run dev`.<br>
  > **Memory:** “user mentioned that `npm run dev` did not work”<br>
  > **Learning:** “for this repo, always use `pnpm dev:all` to start the full local stack — `npm run dev` only starts the frontend and causes missing service errors”

  Instead of re-exploring, Claude starts from the proven path—reducing planning steps, latency, and token usage.

- 🌐 **Project-specific and shared skills:** Session memory disappears with the conversation. Project-specific skills preserve repo-local rules, while shared skills roll up patterns that should transfer across projects. Preferences stay scoped to the current project so per-repo preferences don't leak across projects.

- 🪶 **Better context without prompt bloat:** Distilled, deduplicated skills stay in dozens of tokens—not thousands—even as the project grows.

## Quick Start

### Claude Code

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ReflexioAI/claude-smart
claude plugin install claude-smart@reflexioai
```

The plugin Setup hook installs its own `uv`, Python 3.12 environment, and
private Node.js/npm runtime under `~/.claude-smart/` when they are missing, so
you do not need to install Python or Node globally for the plugin/dashboard.

If you already have Node.js or uv, these convenience wrappers are equivalent
but require their own runtime to already exist:

```bash
npx claude-smart install     # or: uvx claude-smart install
```

Then restart Claude Code.

To uninstall:

```bash
claude plugin uninstall claude-smart@reflexioai
```

Or, if you already have Node.js or uv:

```bash
npx claude-smart uninstall     # or: uvx claude-smart uninstall
```

### Codex

You need the `codex` CLI on `PATH` and Node.js available for `npx`:

```bash
npx claude-smart install --host codex
```

The helper registers the bundled **ReflexioAI** marketplace with Codex and
enables Codex plugin hooks. Then:

1. Fully quit and reopen Codex in your project.
2. Run `/plugins`.
3. Install `claude-smart` from the **ReflexioAI** marketplace.
4. Restart Codex again so hooks reload.

Do not create a `~/plugins/claude-smart` symlink for a normal `npx` install;
that symlink is only for plugin development from a cloned checkout.

Installing from a clone is only for plugin development; see
[DEVELOPER.md](./DEVELOPER.md#developing-locally).

Codex and Claude Code intentionally share the same `CLAUDE_SMART_*` environment
variables, `~/.reflexio/` data, `~/.claude-smart/` session buffers, backend,
dashboard, and learned skills/preferences.


To uninstall:

```bash
npx claude-smart uninstall --host codex
```

This removes the Codex marketplace registration, installed plugin config, and
Codex plugin cache. Local data under `~/.reflexio/` and `~/.claude-smart/` is
left in place — remove manually if desired. Restart Codex after uninstalling.

Developing the plugin itself? See [DEVELOPER.md](./DEVELOPER.md#developing-locally).
> **Not supported:** Claude Code Cowork, claude.ai/code web, or remote Codex environments without local plugin hooks — they run outside your local machine, so the local backend/dashboard and `~/.reflexio/` aren't reachable.

## Key Features

- 🧠 **Learn, don't just remember** — Corrections become structured, deduplicated rules, not transcript replays.
- ⚡ **Fully automatic learning** — Every user turn, tool call, and assistant response is captured via lifecycle hooks and extracted into rules without you running anything.
- 📈 **Continuously self-tuning, not just append-on-conflict** — Existing rules are continuously refined, not just appended to. Wording gets clearer, *when-to-apply* triggers tighten or broaden as evidence accumulates, near-duplicates merge, stale rules are superseded, and dead ones are archived. The library gets sharper, not just bigger.
  > *e.g.* correct the same `npm test --run` gotcha twice → consolidated into one rule. New evidence shows it applies to `vitest` too → scope broadened. Switch policy to `pnpm test` → old rule archived, new one supersedes it.
- 🔌 **No external API call** — semantic search runs on an in-process ONNX embedder (all-MiniLM-L6-v2), and all data (preferences, skills, interaction buffers) is stored locally on your machine (`~/.reflexio/` and `~/.claude-smart/`).
- 🔎 **Hybrid search** — Skills and preferences are indexed with vector + BM25 search for fast, robust retrieval.
- 🧪 **Offline resilience** — If the reflexio backend is down, hooks buffer to disk; the next successful publish drains them.
- 🧰 **Manual correction marker** — `/claude-smart:learn` in Claude Code, or `bash ~/.reflexio/plugin-root/scripts/cli.sh learn` in Codex, flags the last turn as a correction so the extractor weights it heavily.

## Dashboard

A web UI for browsing session histories, inspecting preferences, and editing project-specific and shared skills. The dashboard auto-starts alongside the backend, so you can open **http://localhost:3001** directly. Or run `/claude-smart:dashboard` in Claude Code to launch dashboard in browser. In Codex, run `bash ~/.reflexio/plugin-root/scripts/dashboard-open.sh`.

## How It Works

claude-smart builds three artifacts as you work and injects the relevant ones into Claude Code or Codex:

- **Preferences** (project-scoped) — how you work in this specific repo (stack, role, small quirks). *e.g.* "uses pnpm, not npm"; "prefers terse answers"; "backend engineer — explain frontend with backend analogues."
- **Project-specific skills** — durable rules with triggers and rationales learned from corrections in a project. *e.g.* "always pass `--run` to `npm test` — watch mode hangs CI."
- **Shared skills** — optimized rollups of project-specific skills that should transfer across projects. *e.g.* "use real Postgres for integration tests — mocks once hid a broken migration."

Skills clean themselves up: correct the same thing twice and they merge; change your mind and the old one is archived.

Under the hood: hooks watch your turns, tool calls, and assistant replies, auto-flagging corrections (or anything you flag with `/learn`). At session end (or on `/learn`), [reflexio](https://github.com/ReflexioAI/reflexio) — the self-improving engine that powers claude-smart — extracts preferences and project-specific skills, then rolls durable patterns into shared skills. On each new user prompt, claude-smart searches for matching context and injects only the relevant hits. Run `/show` or the equivalent CLI command to audit the current learned state. Everything runs on your machine.

**Citations.** At the end of a reply, the assistant may append a short marker:

```
✨ 2 claude-smart learnings applied [cs:s1-252,p1-5aed]
```

That signals a preference (`p…`) or skill (`s…`) materially shaped the reply.
Standalone wrappers like `✨abc123✨` are not claude-smart citations and will not
link back to dashboard entries. Open the interaction's detail page in the
[dashboard](#dashboard) to see the exact cited item.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for hooks, data flow, and reflexio details.

## Commands

Claude Code installs these as slash commands. In Codex, run the equivalent shell
command directly, or ask Codex to run it.

| Claude Code | Codex / shell | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/dashboard` | `bash ~/.reflexio/plugin-root/scripts/dashboard-open.sh` | Open the dashboard in your browser, auto-starting the reflexio backend and dashboard services if they aren't already running. |
| `/show` | `bash ~/.reflexio/plugin-root/scripts/cli.sh show` | Print current project-specific skills, shared skills, and the current project's preferences so you can audit learned state manually. |
| `/learn [note]` | `bash ~/.reflexio/plugin-root/scripts/cli.sh learn --note "optional note"` | Flag the most recent turn as a correction (for cases the automatic heuristic missed) and force reflexio to run extraction *now* on the session's unpublished interactions. The optional note becomes the correction description the extractor sees. |
| `/restart` | `bash ~/.reflexio/plugin-root/scripts/cli.sh restart` | Restart the reflexio backend and dashboard to pick up new changes (e.g. after upgrading the plugin or editing local reflexio code). |
| `/clear-all` | `bash ~/.reflexio/plugin-root/scripts/cli.sh clear-all --yes` | **Destructive.** Delete *all* reflexio interactions, preferences, and skills. Use when you want to wipe learned state and start fresh. |

## Configuration

Advanced users can tune claude-smart via environment variables — see [DEVELOPER.md](./DEVELOPER.md#environment-variables) for the full list.

### Where data lives

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.reflexio/data/reflexio.db` | Source of truth for learned preferences, skills, interactions, full-text indexes, and embedding tables (plus `.db-shm` / `.db-wal` WAL sidecars). Inspect with `sqlite3`. |
| `~/.reflexio/.env` | Provider config — `CLAUDE_SMART_USE_LOCAL_CLI`, `CLAUDE_SMART_USE_LOCAL_EMBEDDING`, any optional API keys. |
| `.claude/settings.local.json` or `~/.claude/settings.json` | Claude Code hook environment, such as `CLAUDE_SMART_ENABLE_OPTIMIZER`; use project-local settings for one repo or user settings for all projects. |
| `~/.codex/config.toml` | Codex feature flags, including `plugin_hooks = true` after `claude-smart install --host codex`. |
| `~/.codex/plugins/cache/reflexioai/claude-smart/<version>/` | Codex's cached install of the `claude-smart` plugin from the `ReflexioAI` marketplace. |
| `~/.reflexio/plugin-root` | Self-healed symlink to the active plugin dir (managed by `ensure-plugin-root.sh` — written on install, refreshed each `SessionStart`). Slash commands resolve through it, so don't delete it; if you do, the next session will recreate it. |
| `~/.claude-smart/sessions/{session_id}.jsonl` | Per-session buffer. User turns, assistant turns, tool invocations, `{"published_up_to": N}` watermarks. Safe to inspect and safe to delete — everything past the latest watermark has already been written to reflexio's DB. |
| `~/.cache/chroma/onnx_models/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/` | Cached ONNX weights (~86 MB, downloaded once). Delete to force a re-download. |
